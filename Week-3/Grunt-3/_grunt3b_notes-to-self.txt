Week-3b: Compound.  Important notes to self go here at the top. 

**===== 10/22 morning session; start @ 0542, finish @ xxxx =====**

You just finished analyzing the traffic light solution from 0505 to 0542. Now
it's on to designing compound data definitions (to represent information that
consists of two or more naturally connected values).

Watching the three videos now. During the second video at 4:23 the Prof. talks
about how the data driven template for compound data definitions is interpreted.
Have a look at the example used in the HtDD page:

(define-struct ball (x y))
;; Ball is (make-ball Number Number)
;; interp. a ball at position x, y 

(define BALL-1 (make-ball 6 10))

#;
(define (fn-for-ball b)
  (... (ball-x b)     ;Number
       (ball-y b)))   ;Number
;; Template rules used:
;;  - compound: 2 fields

You'll only get through watching the first two videos this morning; the last
video is 30 minutes long and the cowabunga! problem will take awhile to really
digest. This topic also have a good number of exercises with it -- it seems
important that you gain a firm understanding of this. Look back and see how much
better you feel about your understanding of data definitions and functions after
making the 3+ week investment in doing the topics all over again, slowly and 
deliberately.

Press on! :-)
