You just started this approach of taking notes to self.  The very top of this note is a place for listing important status items, like what problem you left-off at.

===== 10/12 =====
##1711 to xxxx (time committed will be intermittent)

Nung-poo is taking a nap & Jen is cooking so I'll work on the oatmeal problem, which
is HtDD H1, an itemization.

##0436 to 0651 (2 hours, 15 mins)##

Up early!  Doing HtDD P7 which appears to need two data definitions, an interval and an enumeration.  Took 1 hour and 15 minutes (allotted 35 minutes) and I had to look at the solution.  There was a use of "and" and comparisons that was beyond anything I had ever done so I needed some help.  These examples will prove helpful in the future, especially the comparison operators.

(define (fn-for-hillgrade h)
  (cond [(and (<= 0 h) (< h  3)) (... h)]
        [(and (<= 3 h) (< h  7)) (... h)]
        [(and (<= 7 h) (< h 10)) (... h)]))
		
I don't think there is such a thing as => or >= in Racket.  Also, here's a Prof's note that is more salient now:

Remember that data definitions (or data designs) and function designs are different. So, for example, while both have examples, function examples are wrapped in check-expect and show how the function is supposed to run. Data examples are defined as constants using define and show how the data definition represents domain information. Try not to confuse the two.

At 0611, started on HtDD H2, direction; finished at 0619.
At 0626, started on HtDD H3, dinner; finished at 0643. Checking Prof's answer and taking notes.

See the solution for dinners and note the differences between your solution and the Prof's solution.  Yours works, but did you go about it in an "OK" fashion?

===== 10/11 =====
##0530 to 0627 (1 hour)##
Starting @ 0530. Start with HtDD P3 only to learn that you already did it. You overwrote your file with a new template which allowed you to use git's checkout command for the first time to revert back to the original.

Did HtDD P5. Style is important! How would you enforce a style on 3-tier projects? How might you use SPD templates with another language, like PHP?

Started HtDD P6 at 0558; finished at 0623. Went 5 minutes over but the exercise went quite well. I really feel like I'm beginning to "get it" and I'm now sure I made the right decision to stop in week 3 and start all over again at week 1.  I had to slow down, but now I feel like I'm absorbing the material.  I also am beginning to see what the Prof. meant when he said that you're always working on a piece of the overall problem at a time. Now that I'm "getting it", there is a better flow of work occurring.

Hope to get more time in this evening...nope.  In bed before 2100, but...

===== 10/10 @ 0556 =====
Completed HtDD P2, building demolish.  Went well. Allotted 20 mins. & finished in 17 mins.
Skipping HtDD P3 because I don't have enough time to complete before work.
HtDD P4 is 8 mins; completed in 7 mins., however, you rushed it and should have referred to
  the HtDD page on enumerations wherein the structure used in the cond -- string=? -- is clearly shown.  You stumbled by using pass? instead of string=?.  
Signing-off for this morning after doing a git commit...
