Important notes to self go here at the top. 

===== 10/14 morning session; start @ 0510, finish @ 0625 =====

I'll soon see if Im wrong about this but it's going to take awhile to really
understand this material well.

At 0615, stopped. Need to view "HtDW - Working through the Wish List" next where
you'll fill-in the helper functions, which are marked with the !!! characters.

There are three (3) signatures in the function part of the program:

Cat -> Cat    ; for starting the big bang world
Cat -> Cat    ; to advance the image one pixel to the right
Cat -> Image  ; to render the cat image at the appropriate place

Each signature has a purpose to explain what's happening & why it's needed.
These concepts are making a little more sense now that I re-did weeks 1 & 2.
