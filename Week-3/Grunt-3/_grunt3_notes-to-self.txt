Week-3: HtDW.  Important notes to self go here at the top. 

===== 10/15 morning session; start @ 0530, finish @ 0625 =====
Stopped at 0625. Next to view is Improving a World Program - Add SPEED.

(define (main c)
  (big-bang c                         ; Cat
            (on-tick   advance-cat)   ; Cat -> Cat
            (to-draw   render)))      ; Cat -> Image
       
The code above bears some discussion because lessons were learned this time
around.

Cat
---
The variable c is the Cat position.  If you start the program with (main 125),
the Cat starts at x-position 125.  Note, too, that when we invoke big-bang we
must tell it where the Cat, c, is.

Cat -> Cat
----------
(define (advance-cat c)
  (+ c 1))
Once we know this position, c, on-tick can use the advance-cat function: recall
that advance-cat takes a cat and produces a cat, i.e., Cat -> Cat. We advance
Cat by adding some value to c, (+ c 1) in this case, and produce a new value of
c.

Cat -> Image
------------
(define (render c)
   (place-image CAT-IMG c CTR-Y MTS))
The render function will also use c as the location it places CAT-IMG using the
place-image primitive.

===== 10/14 morning session; start @ 0510, finish @ 0625 =====

I'll soon see if Im wrong about this but it's going to take awhile to really
understand this material well.

At 0615, stopped. Need to view "HtDW - Working through the Wish List" next where
you'll fill-in the helper functions, which are marked with the !!! characters.

There are three (3) signatures in the function part of the program:

Cat -> Cat    ; for starting the big bang world
Cat -> Cat    ; to advance the image one pixel to the right
Cat -> Image  ; to render the cat image at the appropriate place

Each signature has a purpose to explain what's happening & why it's needed.
These concepts are making a little more sense now that I re-did weeks 1 & 2.
