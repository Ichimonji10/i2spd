You just started this approach of taking notes to self.  The very top of this note is
a place for listing important status items, like what problem you left-off at.

===== 10/11 =====
##0530 to 0627 (1 hour)##
Starting @ 0530. Start with HtDD P3 only to learn that you already did it. You overwrote your file with a new template which allowed you to use git's checkout command for the first time to revert back to the original.

Did HtDD P5. Style is important! How would you enforce a style on 3-tier projects? How might you use SPD templates with another language, like PHP?

Started HtDD P6 at 0558; finished at 0623. Went 5 minutes over but the exercise went quite well. I really feel like I'm beginning to "get it" and I'm now sure I made the right decision to stop in week 3 and start all over again at week 1.  I had to slow down, but now I feel like I'm absorbing the material.  I also am beginning to see what the Prof. meant when he said that you're always working on a piece of the overall problem at a time. Now that I'm "getting it", there is a better flow of work occurring.

Hope to get more time in this evening...

===== 10/10 @ 0556 =====
Completed HtDD P2, building demolish.  Went well. Allotted 20 mins. & finished in 17 mins.
Skipping HtDD P3 because I don't have enough time to complete before work.
HtDD P4 is 8 mins; completed in 7 mins., however, you rushed it and should have referred to
  the HtDD page on enumerations wherein the structure used in the cond -- string=? -- is
  clearly shown.  You stumbled by using pass? instead of string=?.  
Signing-off for this morning after doing a git commit...
